|Service topology| topology is a visual representation of the invocation relationships and dependencies between services. |--|:---|
|CPM | Calls Per Minites. |CPM
| SLA | Short for Service-Level Agreement, calculated as `((calls - errorCalls) * 100) / calls)`|
| Apdex|Application Performance Index is a quantitative assessment of application performance, based on a user-defined application response time threshold (Apdex T) calculated as a value between 0 and 1. Apdex classifies application performance from the user's perspective into Apdex classifies application performance from the user's perspective into three levels: satisfied, tolerated, and disappointed. These are distinguished in the console interface using different colors. |Apdex
|Apdex Threshold|The application response time threshold used for Apdex calculations, usually denoted by T. The value is user-defined and is expressed in units of T. The value is user-defined in milliseconds (ms) and defaults to 100 ms. For more information, see the **Apdex Principles and Calculation Rules** below|
|Tracer| identifies the entire request chain, i.e., the combination of some columns of Span. Its own ID will be carried throughout the call chain, and each Span in it must carry this traceId, so the traceId will be passed throughout the call chain. |TraceId
|TraceID|TraceId refers to the ID in the Tracer that represents the unique request, which is typically generated by the first system in the cluster to process the request. |TraceID
|ErrorRate| The percentage of errors based on the number of requests during the specified time period. | Throughput
| Throughput| The throughput trend of requests processed during the specified time period|
| RT Distribution| The distribution of the response time (Response Time) for the application to process requests within the specified time period. Green dots represent successful request response; red dots represent failed request response. |RT

## Apdex Principle and Calculation Rules
Apdex is calculated based on a user-defined application response time threshold (Apdex T), which translates application response time statistics into a quantifiable user satisfaction rating for application performance ranging from 0 to 1. Based on real user experience, Apdex classifies application performance into three levels: satisfied, tolerated, and disappointed.

The correspondence between Apdex application performance levels and response times is shown in the following table.

| Response Classification | Response Time Taken (RT) | User Satisfaction Level |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Normal calls|0 < RT <= T|Satisfied|
|Slow Call|T < RT <= 4T |Tolerating
|Very Slow Call|RT > 4T|Frustrated|

The Apdex score is calculated using the following formula.

For example, when T = 100 ms, in a certain time period, an application responds to 60 calls that take less than 100 ms (i.e., normal calls), 20 calls that take between 100 ms and 400 ms (i.e., slow calls), and 20 calls that take more than 400 ms (i.e., very slow calls) with errors If the total number of calls and errors is 20, the application's Apdex = (60 + 0.5 * 20) / (60 + 20 + 20) = 0.7 for that time period, and its performance status is good
